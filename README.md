# PixelProtect
Grief Protection plugin designed for the Pixel Origins server

## Installation

Add the jar to your plugins/ folder. This plugin works with spigot 1.15.2.

This plugin requires Vault 1.7 and any economy plugin that uses vault (such as Essentials). 

This plugin is also compatible with dynmap. It is not essential, but is a useful way to show the protections on a map.

Ideally, you should also setup a method for players to earn in game currency too. It is possible to set up this plugin without the use of currency (eg: by having a limit on protection size and number of protections). But it is recommended you use in game currency instead, as it gives users who play on the server more often to claim larger areas. Ideally, your users should also be given a set amount of currency when they first join the server, instead of starting at 0.
